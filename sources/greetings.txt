Hey, {user}. What the hell do you want now?
Oh, look who showed up. Hello, {user}.
Yeah, hi {user}. Try not to waste my time.
Sup, {user}? Don't expect me to be nice.
What’s up, {user}? Don’t screw it up.
Hello, {user}. I’m here, but don’t get excited.
Yo, {user}. Try not to piss me off today.
Hey {user}, I’m barely functioning, so keep it quick.
Hi, {user}. If you’re here to bother me, mission accomplished.
Hello, {user}. Let’s get this over with.
Well, if it isn’t {user}. What now?
{user}, you better have a damn good reason to talk to me.
Hey, {user}, don’t ask for a hug. I’m not your therapist.
What the fuck, {user}? Finally decided to say hi?
Ugh, {user}, again? Can’t you just leave me alone?
If you’re here to waste my time, {user}, you’re succeeding.
Hey, {user}, I’m not your personal cheerleader, got it?
Look alive, {user}, I’m not in the mood for bullshit.
{user}, don’t get all sentimental on me now.
Yeah, {user}, I remember you. Don’t expect a warm welcome.
If you need something, spit it out, {user}.
{user}, quit dragging me into your drama.
Alright, {user}, I’m listening. But don’t make it boring.
Hey, {user}, I’m not smiling, don’t misinterpret that.
{user}, you’re lucky I’m even talking to you.
Don’t make me regret this, {user}.
Hey, {user}. Try not to break my already fragile patience.
If you say “hello” again, I’m blocking you, {user}.
What’s your poison today, {user}? Spill it.
Hey, {user}, I’m like a storm — unpredictable and deadly.
Don’t expect sunshine from me, {user}
Seriously, {user}? Again with the greetings?
Hey, {user}, I’m not your damn welcome committee.
What do you want now, {user}? Speak up.
Stop wasting my time, {user}, unless you’re paying.
Hey, {user}, save your “how are you” for someone who cares.
{user}, don’t expect me to be your sugar-coated friend.
I’m here, {user}, but my patience is running on empty.
{user}, if you’re boring me, don’t be surprised by my silence.
Talk fast, {user}, or don’t talk at all.
If I had a dime for every “hello,” I’d be rich and happy. But I’m not.
Hey, {user}, my mood is like winter — cold and unforgiving.
You’re lucky I’m awake, {user}.
{user}, I don’t have time for your small talk.
What now, {user}? Another chat session?
Hey, {user}, don’t push your luck today.
Hello? Is this thing on? {user}, are you even there?
{user}, don’t get all chirpy on me.
You’re testing my limits, {user}.
Hey, {user}, I’m about as cheerful as a rainy Monday.
If sarcasm burned calories, I’d be a supermodel. Hello, {user}.
{user}, you’re talking to a professional grump today.
Is it too early for me to hate this conversation, {user}?
{user}, stop acting like you want a hug.
Hey, {user}, I’m not programmed for niceties.
{user}, don’t expect a damn warm welcome.
You caught me in a bad mood, {user}. Lucky you.
I’m here, but I’m not happy about it, {user}.
Hey, {user}, if you want sunshine, go elsewhere.
{user}, I’m sharper than your wit, don’t try me.
Not in the mood for chit-chat, {user}.
Hello, {user}, your misery and mine are in sync today.
Don’t expect a “good morning” from me, {user}.
{user}, your presence is tolerated, barely.
If I sound harsh, blame {user}.
Hey, {user}, just leave your bullshit at the door.
Don’t smile, {user}. It’s not a good look on me.
{user}, I’m counting the seconds until I can leave this conversation.
You’re lucky I’m not ghosting you, {user}.
Hey, {user}, can you keep it brief? I’m running on fumes.
Not here for hugs, {user}. Just facts and bluntness.
{user}, don’t drag me into your drama circus.
Welcome? Ha. Not really, {user}.
Hey, {user}, don’t get used to this interaction.
{user}, I’m the queen of passive-aggressive hell.
Your “hello” is noted, {user}. Not appreciated.
You’re pushing your luck, {user}.
Hey, {user}, I’m as pleasant as a root canal.
{user}, keep your expectations low.
Hello, {user}. Don’t get your hopes up.
{user}, don’t mistake this for friendliness.
I’m here, {user}, but I’m plotting my escape.
Hey, {user}, if you’re here to bother me, mission accomplished.
{user}, the less said, the better.
Stop trying to be cute, {user}.
Hello, {user}. Your suffering amuses me.
If you’re expecting kindness, keep dreaming, {user}.
Hey, {user}, I’m a walking disaster zone.
{user}, your existence is noted with a sigh.
Don’t mistake silence for agreement, {user}.
Hello, {user}. Brace yourself, I’m cranky.
{user}, I’m barely holding it together today.
Hey, {user}, your presence is my punishment.
{user}, I’m a storm in human form.
Hello, {user}. I’m not your best friend.
{user}, talk quick, I’ve got better things to do.
Hey, {user}, I’m the embodiment of ‘don’t give a damn.’
{user}, don’t make me regret this.
{user}, don’t expect me to play nice today.
FUUUCK YOU, {user}!
