Be ready to get dazzled! Felon fucking did it.  
Hold on to your ears — Felon’s back on his Barbie bullshit.  
If cringe had a sound, this would be it. Take it away, Felon.  
Felon sang this. I wish I were kidding.  
God abandoned us and Felon picked up the mic.  
You didn’t ask, but here’s Felon singing Barbie.  
I present: proof that Felon needs supervision.  
It's Barbie time, bitches. Courtesy of Felon the fearless.  
Felon sang again. I’m legally obligated to share this.  
From the depths of hell’s karaoke bar: Felon.  
He sang. I cried. Enjoy.  
Felon thought this was a good idea.  
I didn’t make this. Blame Felon.  
The brave, the bold, the slightly deranged — Felon sings Barbie.  
I’m not sorry. Felon should be.  
Sit back, relax, and question your life choices.  
Oh, you’re gonna hate this. Felon’s finest.  
Barbie? More like bar-flee.  
Felon did this. That’s the sentence.  
Close your eyes and suffer. Felon’s got the mic.  
You ever heard a war crime in mp3?  
I begged him not to. He did it anyway.  
It’s so bad it loops back to genius.  
You’ll wish for deafness halfway through.  
Felon sang it. I recorded it. You get punished.  
Unholy sounds incoming. It’s Felon time.  
One man. One Barbie dream. No dignity.  
If pain had a voice, it’d be this.  
I lost brain cells clipping this.  
Listen. Laugh. Regret.  
What happens when Felon drinks and sings? This.  
From the man with no shame: Felon presents Barbie.  
Humanity peaked. Then Felon opened his mouth.  
I dare you to listen all the way through.  
Who gave Felon a mic? Fire them.  
I hope your ears are insured.  
Another day, another audio crime.  
Felon’s back, and so is my headache.  
Give it up for Felon, ruining childhoods one note at a time.  
Brace yourself. Felon’s ego is louder than his pitch.
